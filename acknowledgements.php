        As always, I'd like to give a huge shoutout to Laker Robotics for taking a chance on me back in 2015, giving me such a great opportunity to learn more than I ever could have imagined,
        and continuing to be a great organization after my class's graduation. I would not be the man I am today without that experience back in the day.
        I still can't believe it's been almost 10 years since Laker Robotics took me in, man I'm getting old!
